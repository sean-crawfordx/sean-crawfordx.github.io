        <h3>🧠 Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset 🌱</h3>
        <p>
          Until recently, people believed our brains were “set in stone” at
          birth, fixed and unable to change. But now, thanks to science, we know
          that’s not true. Our brains are flexible and constantly change based
          on what we do, think, and learn, This is called neuroplasticity.<br />
          Our mindset is how we think about our abilities which can either help
          or hold us back.
        </p>

        <h3>🔁 What Is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is your brain’s ability to change and grow. Every time
          you learn something new, your brain creates or strengthens connections
          between brain cells (called neurons).<br />
          Have you ever struggled with a skill, like playing an instrument or
          riding a bike, and then grown better over time? That’s
          neuroplasticity in action.<br />
          The more you practice, the stronger the brain pathways become. You’re
          building a stronger brain.
        </p>
        <h3>💡 Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>You’re not stuck with the brain you were born with.</p>

        <p>You can constantly improve at any age.</p>

        <p>

          ADHD, depression, or learning difficulties.
        </p>

        <h3>🚀 How To Boost Neuroplasticity</h3>

        <h3>🌟 What Is a Growth Mindset?</h3>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is the belief that your abilities and intelligence
          can improve with effort and learning. This idea comes from
          psychologist Carol Dweck. A fixed mindset, on the other hand, is the
          belief that you’re either smart or not, and that’s it.
        </p>
        <h3>🎯 Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          If you believe you can grow and learn you’re likelier to try harder,
          bounce back from mistakes, and feel proud of your progress, not just
          perfection.
        </p>
        <h3>🧩 What Surprised Me</h3>
        <p>
          I realised how often we accidentally give people fixed mindset
          messages
        </p>
        <p>“You’re so smart!” or “You’re not a math person.”</p>
        <p>They sound nice but can make people afraid to fail.</p>
        <h3>💬 How I’ll Use It</h3>
        <p>
          I’ll remind myself that effort and mistakes are part of learning. I
          won’t say, “I’m just bad at this.” I’ll say, “I’m not good at this
          YET”.<br />

          I’ll keep pushing, even when it’s tough — because that’s when my brain
          is growing.

        <h3>ðŸ§  Emotional Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
        Emotional Intelligence means being aware of your own feelings and the
        feelings of others. It helps you manage emotions, stay calm, and get
        along with people better. People with strong emotional intelligence can
        handle stress, communicate clearly, show empathy, and make thoughtful
        decisions. Itâ€™s not just about being nice â€” itâ€™s about understanding how
        emotions affect behaviour and relationships.
      </p>
      
       <h3> ðŸ†š Whatâ€™s the Difference Between EQ and IQ?</h3>
       <p>
        IQ (Intelligence Quotient) measures how well someone solves problems,
        uses logic, and understands ideas. EQ (Emotional Quotient) is about
        recognizing, understanding, and managing emotions â€” both your own and
        other peopleâ€™s. IQ is about the brain, EQ is about the heart.
      </p>
      
        <h3>ðŸ’¡ Why is EQ Important?</h3>
        <p>
        EQ helps you work well with others, handle conflict, and stay motivated.
        Itâ€™s especially useful in teamwork, leadership, and learning. While IQ
        might help you get a job, EQ helps you succeed in it.

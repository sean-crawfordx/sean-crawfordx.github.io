        <h2>🛠️ Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
        <br>

        <p>
          🌟 My long-term goal is to build a successful career in tech.<br />
          I'm especially interested in cybersecurity, but I’m open to other
          areas too.<br />
          I'm using Dev Academy to explore what's possible, develop my
          confidence, and learn the skills I need to get my foot in the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          🎯 I want to use these skills to get a job in tech, ideally something
          related to cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and helping people stay
          safe online.<br />
          I'd love to be part of a team that solves real-world problems. I also
          want to be someone who helps others, like I've been helped.<br />
          When I’m more confident, I want to pass on what I’ve learned to others
          just starting.
        </p>
        <p>
          💪 My biggest strengths are being open-minded, determined, and willing
          to learn.<br />
          I’m learning to express myself to others and not to be afraid to ask
          questions.<br />
          My main limitation is still getting fully confident with computers and
          communicating through tech, but I'm improving every day. I’m working
          on reaching out when I need help.
        </p>
        <p>
          🔄 My confidence is growing with tech and communicating with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          🧠 Staying balanced will be my biggest non-technical challenge at
          Bootcamp.<br />
          I need to remember to pace myself, step back when needed, and keep
          talking to people instead of bottling things up.
        </p>
        <p>
          🤝 I want to be better at communicating clearly (especially in
          groups), working smoothly in pairs, giving and receiving feedback
          kindly, staying aware of how I’m feeling, and keeping calm under
          pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          🧑‍🏫 I expect LOTS of patience 😄.<br />
          I appreciate when things are explained in plain language, and I’m
          hoping for lots of laughs!
        </p>
        <p>
          💥 I will give this 100%.<br />
          I will show up, be honest, and keep doing my best — even when it’s
          hard.<br />
          If I’m struggling, I’ll let someone know. I’ll support others where I
          can, and take breaks when I need to.<br />
          My goal is progress, not perfection, YET.
        </p>
        <p>
          🆘 If I’m stuck, I’ll reach out to the people around me.<br />
          I know I’m not doing this alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          ✅ I will share my thoughts and problems, and manage my time and
          energy with care.<br />
          I'll set clear start and stop times, take breaks, move my body, and
          connect with people outside of Bootcamp.

        <br>
        <p>
          🌟 My long-term goal is to be successful, and my eyes are open for
          anything after Dev.<br />
          Leaning towards cybersecurity. 🛡️💻
        </p>
        <p>
          💪 My strengths are being open-minded, wanting to learn and grow, and
          my determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          🧱 My limitations are learning how to operate a computer and
          communicate through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          🛤️ I would like to develop new pathways of learning and communicating.
        </p>
        <p>
          🎯 I am 100% committed to Dev Academy and everyone involved with my
          learning journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          🛑 If things build up and are starting to get to me, I'll step back
          and talk to someone, reach out and let people know how I’m feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          📞 I will communicate with everyone around me — Gaby, David, and text
          bomb Joseph. 💬
        </p>
        <p>🧘‍♂️ I am expecting from the facilitation team LOTS of patience.</p>
        <p>
          🏋️‍♂️ Hobbies and exercise in the evenings after 5:30 pm and some
          weekends. 🌳🚴‍♂️

        <h3>☕ What is JavaScript, and how does it fit with HTML and CSS?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Think of building a webpage like baking a cake: HTML is the
          ingredients—the flour, sugar and eggs. It gives your cake (your page)
          structure.<br />
          <br />
          CSS is the decoration—the icing, sprinkles, and color. It makes your
          cake look nice.
        </p>
        <p>

        JavaScript is what makes your cake magical.<br />
        It lets your cake sing "Happy Birthday" or change flavor when someone
        takes a bite 🍰🎶
        </p>
        <p>

        In more technical terms:
        </p>
        <p>
        HTML tells the browser what elements are on the page (like buttons, text
        and images). CSS makes those elements look nice.
        </p>
        <p>

        JavaScript makes those elements interactive—so when you click a button,
        something actually happens!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Adding JavaScript to a button
        </p>
        <p>
        Let’s say you want a button on your page that changes its text when
        clicked.
        </p>

        <p>First, the HTML adds the button:</p>
        <img class="container" src="images/java1.png" alt="Javascript & Html" />

        <p>
          Then you use JavaScript to tell the button what to do when someone
          clicks it:
        </p>

        <img class="container" src="images/java2.png" alt="Javascript & Html" />

        <p>
          Finally, you connect the two:<br />
          <br />
          <img
            class="container"
            src="images/java3.png"
            alt="Javascript & Html"
          />
        </p>

        <p>Now, when someone clicks the button, JavaScript changes the text!</p>

        <h3>🗺️ What is the DOM?</h3>
        <br />

        <p>
          The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a map of your webpage.<br />
          Just like a map shows where different buildings, roads, and landmarks
          are. The DOM shows where the different parts of your webpage live,<br> like
          headings, paragraphs, images, and links.<br />
          <br />
          When your browser loads a page, it uses this map to determine what to
          show and where.<br />
          JavaScript can also use this map to find locations and make changes,
          like changing text, updating styles, or adding new elements.
        </p>
        <p>HTML</p>
        <img class="container" src="images/java4.png" alt="Javascript & Html" />

        <p>Changing text with javascript</p>
        <img class="container" src="images/java5.png" alt="Javascript & Html" />

        <p>
          JavaScript uses the DOM to find the place marked "title" on the map
          and updates the text to say “Welcome everyone!”
        </p>
      </section>
      <br />
      <section>
        <h3>🌳 What are Nodes in the DOM?</h3>
        <br />

        <p>
          When people talk about “nodes” in JavaScript, they’re talking about
          the building blocks of a webpage.<br />
          <br />
          You can imagine your webpage is a family tree, where everything is a
          branch (or a "node").<br />
          <br />
          In the DOM every HTML element is a node, and even the text inside
          those elements is a node!
        </p>
        <p>HTML</p>
        <img class="container" src="images/java6.png" alt="Javascript & Html" />
        <br />
        <p>
          JavaScript can create new nodes, add them, remove them or replace
          them. Kind of like editing a recipe by adding or swapping
          ingredients.<br />
          <br />

        <h3>🔄 Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Like doing laundry Control flow is just the order in which your code
          runs, kind of like a set of instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loops let you repeat steps again and again without writing them a
          bunch of times.
        </p>
        <p>
        Let’s use doing laundry as an example:<br />
        Control flow: You start by sorting clothes → washing → drying → folding
        → done.
        </p>
        

        <p>
          Loop: If you have a basket full of socks, you don’t say “put away
          sock” a hundred times, you say “for each sock in the basket, put it
          away.”
        </p>
        <br />

        <img class="container" src="images/java8.png" alt="Javascript & Html" />

        <p>This loop runs once for each sock in the drawer.</p>
      </section>
      <br />
      <section>
        <h3>🧺 Arrays vs Objects</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          An array is like a sock drawer: Inside is a bunch of items in order
          and you grab them by number (index).
        </p>

        <p>
          An object is like a labelled box: you grab things by name (key), like
          “shirt” or “hat.”
        </p>
        <img
          class="container"
          src="images/java11.png"
          alt="Javascript & Html"
        />
        <br />

        <br />
        <img class="container" src="images/java9.png" alt="Javascript & Html" />

        <p>Both hold data, but they organize it differently.</p>

        <h3>🔧 What are Functions?</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          A function is like a reusable recipe. You give it ingredients (a
          parameter) and it makes something useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of repeating code, you put it in a function and use it
          whenever you need it.
        </p>
        <img
          class="container"
          src="images/java10.png"
          alt="Javascript & Html"
        />

        <p>
          Functions save time and make your code easier to understand, just like
          using a recipe card instead of guessing each time.

        A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name
        must only be used by one HTML element within the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use classes for styles that you want to apply to multiple elements, like
        buttons. For example. Class = .
      </p>

      <p>.button {</p>
      <p>
        color: white; background: blue; } Use IDs for unique elements that only
        appear once on the page, like a header or a specific section. For
        example. ID = # #header { font-size: 30px; } An ID is meant to be unique
        because it serves as a specific identifier for an element on the page.
        This is important for several reasons: First, JavaScript often uses IDs
        to target a specific element, and if multiple elements have the same ID,
        JavaScript won't know which one to select. Second, IDs have higher
        specificity in CSS than classes, so using the same ID multiple times can
        cause styling conflicts and make it hard to predict which styles will
        apply. Finally, IDs are useful for accessibility and search engine
        optimization, as they help link to specific parts of a page and allow
        search engines to better understand page structure. Using multiple
        elements with the same ID can lead to confusion in both cases.

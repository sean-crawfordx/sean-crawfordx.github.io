        <h2>🧠 From Frustration to Small Wins: How I’m Learning to Code</h2>
        <br />

        <h3>🧱 A Time I Was Blocked on a Simple Problem</h3>
        <p>
          I was trying to link my JavaScript file to my HTML file. It seemed
          like it should be simple. I’d seen it done in tutorials and assumed it
          would work right away.<br />
          But when I opened the browser, nothing happened. No errors. Just
          nothing. I started guessing what was wrong. I changed file names,
          rearranged folders, and refreshed my browser about a hundred times.
          Eventually, I asked AI for help (thank you ChatGPT!) and realized I
          had made a small typo in the path to my JavaScript file.<br />
          Such a tiny mistake, but it broke everything. I felt frustrated,
          annoyed, and a bit embarrassed. But I also learned that in code,
          little things really matter. Now, I double-check my file paths and
          start with the basics when things don’t work.

        <h3>🎯 A Time I Solved Something Elegantly</h3>

        <p>
          I wanted to make a spinning cube using Three.js. I saw an example
          online and thought it looked cool. The code was already written in one
          block, but I wanted to try splitting it into proper files, like a real
          project setup. At first, I didn’t understand what everything was
          doing, but I used AI to help explain the parts and guide me through
          the process.
          <br />I created separate HTML and JS files, made sure the module
          imports were correct, and used npx vite to serve the project.<br />
          It didn’t feel like I was doing anything super technical, but just
          getting the structure right and seeing the cube spin smoothly in the
          browser made me feel proud. I realized that even organizing existing
          code and getting it running is a step forward in learning.

        <h3>🧪 Reflecting on My Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>

        <p>
          Pseudocode:<br />
          I’m seeing it in lessons and splitting it up to help me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying something:<br />
          Definitely. I try a lot and learn by breaking things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rubber ducky method:<br />
          The duck knows more than I do. 🐤
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading error messages:<br />
          I’m slowly learning to understand them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Console.logging:<br />
          When I can figure out how to split the code to log it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Googling:<br />
          Sometimes it works, sometimes it’s a maze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asking peers/coaches:<br />
          I hesitate sometimes, but I’m working on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflection:<br />
          I don’t understand a lot, but I know deep inside myself I have grown a
          lot. 💪

        <h3>🙋‍♂️ When I Was Reluctant to Ask for Help</h3>
        <p>
          The very first time I started panicking about time-boxes. I felt too
          embarrassed to ask for help on Discord, where everyone could see.<br />
          So instead, I messaged Joseph directly for some of his wisdom — he’s a
          super-communicator and just a really intelligent, supportive
          person.<br />
          Looking back, I realise there’s no shame in asking publicly. We’re all
          learning, and someone else probably has the same question. But in that
          moment, I just wanted help without feeling exposed.<br />
          I’ve been in a trade for nearly 30 years. I’ve always been the kind of
          person who will use any tool I can get my hands on to make my job
          easier.<br />
          And now that I’m learning tech, I take the same approach. I’ll ask for
          help, use AI, dig through forums — whatever it takes.

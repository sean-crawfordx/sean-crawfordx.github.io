        <p>👤 What have I learned about myself and my ego?</p>
        <p>
          I take feedback personally sometimes, but I’m learning that it's okay
          to feel things.<br />
          I can step back and see feedback as a way to grow, not a personal
          attack. I don’t have to be in control, but I like to know where I’m
          heading.<br />
          I'm learning to slow down and trust the process. I’ve avoided asking
          for help, turns out that came from not being open about how I feel.<br />
          I don’t need to fear questions. Questions are how I grow.

          💖 The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
          coding
        </p>
        <p>
          Values guide my decisions and how I work with others. Knowing what
          matters to me helps me work with purpose. Empathy helps me collaborate
          better.<br />
          It’s not just about understanding code, it’s about understanding
          people too. Self-awareness helps me catch my habits and adjust
          them.<br />
          If I get frustrated or distracted, I can pause, reflect, and reset.

        <p>🤯 What surprised me the most?</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to push myself into the human side of this journey, learning
          to listen, speak up, and be more confident around others.<br />
          Programming is a people’s job. These skills make everything easier,
          not harder. I’m genuinely surprised at how open and confident I’m
          becoming.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>🧗‍♂️ What were the most challenging parts?</p>
        <p>
          Being open and not knowing what’s expected freaked me out a bit 😅.<br />
          It was hard to share my thoughts honestly, especially if I felt unsure
          or emotional. But doing it made me feel more connected and supported.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>🤔 Why is a coding bootcamp teaching Human Skills?</p>
        <p>
          Because coding is teamwork. No matter how good I get at JavaScript, if
          I can’t listen, communicate, or reflect, I’ll struggle in real
          jobs.<br />
          Human Skills make me a better teammate, a better learner, and even a
          better problem solver.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>🚫 Was it a waste of time?</p>
        <p>
          Nope. 👎 My objective is to learn how to communicate with people, and
          with myself. <br />Learning to code along the way is a bonus.<br />
          <br />
          Computers can’t smile. YET. 😏

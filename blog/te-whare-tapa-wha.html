        <h3>🌿 Te Whare Tapa Whā</h3>
        <p>
          Te Whare Tapa Whā is a Māori model of wellbeing created by Tā Mason
          Durie in 1984.<br />
          It uses the image of a wharenui (meeting house) to show how wellbeing
          has four walls – and each one needs to be strong for us to feel
          balanced.

        <h3>The 4 Walls of Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>
          🕊️ Taha Wairua – Spiritual wellbeing. Connecting with meaning, values,
          or something sacred.
        </p>

        <p>
          🧠 Taha Hinengaro – Mental & emotional wellbeing. Managing our
          thoughts and feelings, and how we cope with stress.
        </p>

        <p>
          🏃‍♂️ Taha Tinana – Physical wellbeing. Caring for our bodies through
          food, movement, and rest.
        </p>

        <p>
          👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Taha Whānau – Family & Social wellbeing. Relationships, support
          systems, and the people who matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          🌏 Whenua – Land, roots, environment. The land grounds us — nature
          connects us to ourselves and others.
        </p>

        <h3>🌱 Why This Matters</h3>
        <p>
          Dev Academy supports the whole person — not just learning code.<br />
          Te Whare Tapa Whā helps us look after our hauora (wellbeing) while we
          study, grow and support each other.
        </p>

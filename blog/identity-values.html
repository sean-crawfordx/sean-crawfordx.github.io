        Hi Dev team! I’m Sean I was born and raised in the world famous
        Johnsonville, I lived in England for two and a half years. Started my
        own family in Tawa now living in Titahi Bay. I’ve been a flooring
        installer, mainly carpet installation for 29 years. 20 of them have been
        self employed with my own company and staff. Honesty, Reliability and
        Loyalty are values I hold very strongly with everything in my life. I
        joined Dev Academy to learn and grow into a new career and to grow into
        a better person. I’m interested in how things tick, problem solving,
        investigation and habits. I’m always thinking outside the box for new
        ideas, solutions and most importantly ways of having a bloody good
        laugh. I'm excited about being part of a new team and growing together.
        Everyone is different so there is a lot we can learn from each other.

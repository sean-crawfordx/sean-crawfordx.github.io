        🧭 Ethical Decision<br />
        Last year, I made the difficult decision to close down my flooring
        business and let go of my only employee. I had been running the business
        for over 20 years, but I knew it was time to pursue a new path and focus
        on learning software development at Dev Academy. I felt a strong sense
        of responsibility toward my employee and didn’t want to leave him
        without support. I gave him plenty of notice, helped him transition to
        other work, and made sure everything was wrapped up respectfully. It was
        tough, but I believe it was the right decision to move forward with my
        goals while still doing right by someone who had worked with me.
        <br />🌏 Culture and Identity<br />
        I grew up in New Zealand where community, honesty, and humility are
        important. The people around me, especially my family and workmates,
        taught me to be practical, hardworking, and to treat everyone with
        respect. These values still shape who I am today.
        <br />💪 Strengths<br />
        My strengths are perseverance, patience, and practical problem-solving.
        Running my own business for over 20 years taught me how to stick at
        things even when they’re tough. These qualities will keep me showing up
        and learning, especially when things get challenging.
        <br />⚠️ Limitations<br />
        I’m still getting comfortable with computers and writing code. I have
        limited experience in tech, which can make learning slower and more
        frustrating at times. But I’ve found that breaking things down, asking
        for help, and staying consistent helps me get through.
        <br />🤝 Working with Others<br />
        In the past, I’ve worked closely with architects on building projects.
        Sometimes their designs didn’t work in real-world situations due to the
        structure or materials on site. Instead of rejecting their plans
        outright, I would explain what wasn’t possible and why, and then work
        with them to find practical ways to keep the design intent while
        adjusting things to fit. It wasn’t always easy, but I found that clear
        communication and compromise helped us get the best results. If I faced
        something similar now, I’d continue focusing on respectful collaboration
        and finding solutions that work for everyone.

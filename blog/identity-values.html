        <h3>üß≠ Ethical Decision</h3>
        <p>
        Last year, I made the difficult decision to close down my flooring
        business and let go of my only employee.<br> I had been running the business
        for over 20 years, but I knew it was time to pursue a new path and focus
        on learning software development at Dev Academy.<br> I felt a strong sense
        of responsibility toward my employee and didn‚Äôt want to leave him
        without support.<br> I gave him plenty of notice, helped him transition to
        other work, and made sure everything was wrapped up respectfully. It was
        tough, but I believe it was the right decision to move forward with my
        goals while still doing right by someone who had worked with me.
        </p>
        
        <h3>üåè Culture and Identity</h3>
        <p>
        I grew up in New Zealand where community, honesty, and humility are
        important.<br> The people around me, especially my family and workmates,
        taught me to be practical, hardworking, and to treat everyone with
        respect.<br> These values still shape who I am today.
        </p>
        
        <h3>üí™ Strengths</h3>
        <p>
        My strengths are perseverance, patience, and practical problem-solving.<br>
        Running my own business for over 20 years taught me how to stick at
        things even when they‚Äôre tough.<br> These qualities will keep me showing up
        and learning, especially when things get challenging.
        </p>
        <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations</h3>
        <p>
        I‚Äôm still getting comfortable with computers and writing code.<br> I have
        limited experience in tech, which can make learning slower and more
        frustrating at times.<br> But I‚Äôve found that breaking things down, asking
        for help, and staying consistent helps me get through.
        </p>
        <h3>ü§ù Working with Others</h3>
        <p>
        In the past, I‚Äôve worked closely with architects on building projects.<br>
        Sometimes their designs didn‚Äôt work in real-world situations due to the
        structure or materials on site.<br> Instead of rejecting their plans
        outright, I would explain what wasn‚Äôt possible and why, and then work
        with them to find practical ways<br> to keep the design intent while
        adjusting things to fit.<br> It wasn‚Äôt always easy, but I found that clear
        communication and compromise helped us get the best results.<br> If I faced
        something similar now, I‚Äôd continue focusing on respectful collaboration
        and finding solutions that work for everyone.
